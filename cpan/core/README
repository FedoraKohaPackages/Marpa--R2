This directory contains the Libmarpa code used in the basic installation
method, the one supported by the CPAN infrasture.  It also contains
documents describing alternative ways of using Libmarpa -- external
static libraries and external shared libraries.

The code in the "core" subdirectory should *NOT* be used for building
a separate Libmarpa.  It is specifically targeted at the needs of Perl
builds, and may contain specials kludges and hacks.

If you want to build your own separate Libmarpa, build a distribution, or
build a distribution tar file, from Libmarpa's repository.  Instructions
on how to build distribution directories and tar files are in the INSTALL
file at the top level of the repository.  Libmarpa's repository is here:
https://github.com/jeffreykegler/libmarpa

As an advanced technique, Marpa::R2 can be linked with external static
or shared Libmarpa libraries.  Use of external Libmapra libraries is
*NOT* supported by the CPAN infrastructure, which does not deal well
with non-Perl dependencies.

For more on linking with an external static library, see the STATIC file
in this directory.  For more on linking with an external shared library,
see the SHARED file in this directory.
