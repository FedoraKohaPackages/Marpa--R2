This document describes how to link an external static library with
Marpa::R2.  This method, and this document, is intended for re-packagers
and other very advanced users.  This method is not supported by the CPAN
infrastructure.  Most users should perfer the basic method described in
the INSTALL document at the top level of the Marpa::R2 CPAN directory.

Here are the steps:

1.) Be sure the library that you are building is a match to the one
that Marpa::R2 expects.  The expected version can be found in the
core/read_only/LIB_VERSION file.  Do *NOT* edit this file.  This version
number must match exactly the version number of your external static
library.

2.) Build an external static library using the separate Libmarpa
repository.  Libmarpa uses autoconf.  Instructions on how to
build it can be found beginning in the INSTALL file at the top
level of the Libmarpa repository.  Libmarpa's repository is here:
https://github.com/jeffreykegler/libmarpa

3.) Install the external static library.  Where and how you install it
is up to you.  The Libmarpa distribution is set up to use autoconf.
Instructions on how to install using autoconf can be found in the
autoconf documentation.  We will assume that you have installed the
external static library in /tmp/libmarpa.a.

4.) Build Marpa::R2 to use the external static library.

   ./Build code --libmarpa-external=/tmp/libmarpa.a
