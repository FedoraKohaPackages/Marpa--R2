This document describes how to link an external static library with
Marpa::R2.  This method, and this document, is intended for re-packagers
and other very advanced users.  This method is not supported by the CPAN
infrastructure.  Most users should perfer the basic method described in
the INSTALL document at the top level of the Marpa::R2 CPAN directory.

Here are the steps:

1.) Build an external static library using the separate Libmarpa
repository.  Libmarpa uses autoconf.  Instructions on how to
build it can be found beginning in the INSTALL file at the top
level of the Libmarpa repository.  Libmarpa's repository is here:
