=head1 About this document

This document is an overview of B<SLIF parse events>.
The purpose of SLIF parse events is to interrupt SLIF
internal parsing, or "B<trigger>", based on "B<events>" chosen
by the application.
The events available
include things as the prediction or recognition
of symbols.

SLIF parse events are often used to enable the application to
switch over to its own custom procedural logic.
Among other things,
an application can do its own "external" scanning of lexemes.
An application may ask Marpa to resume internal scanning at
any point.

SLIF parse events may be named or unnamed.
Use of unnamed events is discouraged, and should be reserved for legacy
code.
New applications should only use named events.
When not otherwise specified,
this document is talking about named events.
Unnamed events are described
L<below,
in a section dedicated to them|/"Unnamed events">.

SLIF parse events are called B<parse events>
or simply B<events>,
in contexts where the meaning is clear.

SLIF parse events evolved over time from simpler
mechanisms,
and the term SLIF parse event was introduced late
in the development of Marpa::R2.
In previous versions of Marpa::R2,
SLIF parse events and their precursors are called "pauses" or simply "events".
For historical reasons,
some of the method names dealing with SLIF parse events
still have the word "pause" as part of their name.

=head1 The life cycle of events

Events are first B<declared>.
A declared event may B<trigger>.
Once an event triggers, it may be B<accessed>.

Events are declared in the SLIF DSL.
Parse events can be either a lexeme event
or a non-lexeme event.
Lexeme events are declared using
L<a C<:lexeme> pseudo-rules|Marpa::R2::DSL/"Lexeme pseudo-rules">.
Non-lexeme events are declared using
L<named event statements|Marpa::R2::DSL/"Named event statement">.
The various kinds of parse events are described in detail below.
For each type of parse event,
its descriptions
will indicate whether it is a lexeme or a non-lexeme event.

Once declared, events
may trigger during any event-triggering SLIF
recognizer method.
When an event triggers, it causes the event-triggering
method to return immediately, with the current location
at the B<trigger point>.
The event-triggering SLIF recognizer methods are
L<C<read()>|Marpa::R2::Scanless::R/"read()">,
L<C<resume()>|Marpa::R2::Scanless::R/"resume()">,
L<C<lexeme_read()>|Marpa::R2::Scanless::R/"lexeme_read()"> and
L<C<lexeme_complete()>|Marpa::R2::Scanless::R/"lexeme_complete()">.
Non-lexeme events may trigger during any of the event-triggering
methods.
Lexeme events will only trigger during calls of the
C<< $slr->read() >> and C<< $slr->resume() >> methods.

When an event triggers, it causes the method
to return immediately, leaving the current location at the location
at which the event triggered -- its B<trigger location>.
Applications need to be aware of a special case --
SLIF parse events may trigger at a location at which the method
would return in any case.

For example, the C<< $slr->read() >> method always returns
at end of string.
But an event may have triggered at the end of string as well.
The code in the synopsis is carefully written to catch
events which trigger at end of string.
Normally, you end the read loop at end of string,
and applications which do not use parse events may do this.
But the code above, after an the end of string is reached,
makes one additional
pass through the 
event-reading logic, in order to report any events which
occurred at end of string.

=head1 Types of parse event

=head2 Completion events

Completion events are non-lexeme events,
and are declared in
L<named event statements|Marpa::R2::DSL/"Named event statement">.
Completion SLIF parse events can be specifed for any
symbol that is not a lexeme.
The completion event triggers
occur whenever a rule with that symbol on
its LHS is fully recognized in the parse.
(The idea is that "symbol completion" occurs when the
rule, and therefore its LHS, is "complete".)
For this purpose,
a nulled symbol is not considered "complete",
and nulled symbols never trigger completion events.
A completion event is never triggered by any
zero-length instance of a symbol.

=head2 Nulling events

Nulling events are non-lexeme events,
and are declared in
L<named event statements|Marpa::R2::DSL/"Named event statement">.
Nulling SLIF parse events may be defined for any symbol
which is not a lexeme.
A nulling SLIF parse event occurs whenever a zero-length symbol instance
is recognized.
Null symbols may derive other null symbols,
and these derivations may be ambiguous.
Ambiguous or not,
all such derivations cause nulling SLIF parse events.

Again,
for this purpose,
a nulled symbol is never considered "complete".
This means that
nulling events and completion events are mutually exclusive --
a nulled, or zero-length, symbol will only trigger a nulling event
and never a completion event.
And any symbol recognized at greater than zero-length will never trigger
a nulling event.

=head2 Prediction events

Prediction SLIF parse events may be defined for any symbol,
whether it is a lexeme or not.
Prediction events are non-lexeme events, even if their symbol
is a lexeme.
A prediction event occurs at any location where a non-zero length
symbol would be accepted by the recognizer.
It can be thought of as occurring when a symbol is "expected".
The expectation may or may not come true, depending on future
input.

There is no actual distinction between expecting
a zero-length symbol,
and actually seeing one.
Zero-length symbols are always regarded as actually being
recognized as soon as they are predicted, and
they never generate prediction events,
only nulling events.

=head2 After-lexeme events

An after-lexeme event is a lexeme event.

=head2 Before-lexeme events

An before-lexeme event is a lexeme event.
A before-lexeme event is B<not>
the same as
a prediction event of a symbol which is a lexeme,
although the two may occur at once.
A before-lexeme event does not occur unless that the lexeme is actually
found in the input.
A prediction event, on the other hand, is
as the name suggests, only a prediction.
The predicted symbol may or not actually be found in the input.

=head1 Unnamed events

Use of unnamed events is strongly discouraged.
However, to support legacy code, unnamed events are still supported
and are still described in this documentation.

Unnamed events are defined in
L<C<:lexeme> pseudo-rules|Marpa::R2::Scanless::DSL/"Lexeme pseudo-rules">,
when
L<the C<pause> adverb|Marpa::R2::Scanless::DSL/"pause"> 
is used without an
L<the C<event> adverb|Marpa::R2::Scanless::DSL/"event">.
(The C<pause> adverb is so named, because
Marpa's SLIF parse events were once called ``pauses''.)
Since the
L<the C<pause> adverb|Marpa::R2::Scanless::DSL/"pause">
does create a SLIF parse event, but
it is the
L<the C<event> adverb|Marpa::R2::Scanless::DSL/"event">
that provide the name for the SLIF parse event,
this results in an event without a name --
an unnamed event.
